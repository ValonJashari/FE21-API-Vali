curl_getinfo()
curl_init() - Initialize a cURLsession and return a cURL handle for use with
curl_setopt(),curl_exec() & curl_close().
CURLOPT_URL 

curl_setopt() -- set an option for a curl transfer
curl_exec() -- Perform a cURL session, execute the given cURL session. After curl session and all options are set, this should be used.
Returns true on success or false on failure. 
However, if the CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER option is set, it will return the:
result on success, false on failure.

curl_close() -- Close a cURL session & frees all resources.

If you set CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER to true or 1 then the return value from curl_exec will be the actual result from the successful operation.
 In other words it will not return TRUE on success. Although it will return FALSE on failure.

As described in the Return Values section of curl-exec PHP manual page: http://php.net/manual/function.curl-exec.php

You should enable the CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION option for redirects but this would be a problem if your server is in safe_mode and/or open_basedir is in effect which can cause issues with curl as well.
